# Everyday_Challenge
HacknRoll Competition Idea

Everyday Challenge is an Android app that 3 of us built during a hackathon (Hack & Roll) from zero Android experience.
It gives a user random challenges, the user can only have a maximum amount of random challenges each day. 

<br/>
The user accumulates points with each challenge and can unlock levels. 
He/she then can share his/her progress through WhatsApp & Facebook with one click from the app.
